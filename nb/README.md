## Downstream Impact

We've included some tests to show how dataset issues can lead to bias in downstream research. We've recreated their methodology, reused their code or taken the original results as given, depending on the analysis. These notebooks are largely, but not completely, plug-and-play: datasets should be downloaded from their original sources and the directory specified in the notebook files where necessary. Some flags also may need to be modified.
