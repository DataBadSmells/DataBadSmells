## Downstream Impact

We've included some tests of how dataset issues can lead to bias in downstream research. We've recreate their methodology, reused their code or taken the original results as given, depending on the analysis. They are not completely plud-and-play: datasets should be downloaded from their original sources and the directory specified in the notebook files where necessary. Some flags also may need to be modified.
